        <p>I've chosen to offer a way to donate to me, for anyone that may be interested in helping to support the maintenance of this website.
		<p>Any donations received will go directly towards hosting this website, with none taken for personal use.
		<p>If you do choose to donate, I and everyone else who uses this website thank you very much for your contribution.
		<p>Donations are temporarily disabled while PayPal sorts their shit out.
		<p>You can donate <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/donations">at this page</a> and just put "for eip" or something in the description.
