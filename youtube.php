        <p>if you are seeing this page, it is because you are using a video guide.
		<br>this is highly discouraged and you should use the relevant guide for your console, such as <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">the 3ds guide</a> or <a href="https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/">the switch guide</a>
		<br>if that advice does not help you, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/dQgV6ZG" target="_blank">Nintendo Homebrew</a> discord and ask us for help there.
		<br>if you're a youtube video guide creator and you are reading this page: you know why this page exists. i gave you a chance to change things and you did not.
		<br>this is the future you chose.
